\section BinWlz_intro  Introduction
Most of the woolz core image processing library procedure
 have a corresponding programme
 to allow command-line processing of woolz images and image structures
 (e.g. polylines, boundaries, histograms etc). In general each binary
will read one or more woolz objects from "standard input" and write the
result to "standard output" (most will also read from a command line
 arguement if present). Control parameters for each function are typically
entered as arguments. In many cases a sequence of image processing
operations can be concatenated as a Unix "pipeline" which is efficient
and convenient for rapid prototyping and scripting of common operations.

All woolz programmes will have an entry in this documentation but
 will also respond to the flag "-h". For example the programme
 \ref wlzthreshold WlzThreshold will read in a grey-level woolz
 object and apply a high or low threshold, writing the resultant
 object to standard out. The usage parameters are then displayed
 using the "-h" option:
\verbatim
tcsh% WlzThreshold -h
Usage:  WlzThreshold [-t#] [-v#] [-H] [-L] [-h] [<input file>]
        Threshold a grey-level woolz object
        writing the new object to standard output
        Options are:
          -H        Threshold high, keep pixels above threshold value (default).
          -L        Threshold low, keep pixels below threshold value.
	  -E        Threshold equal, keep pixels equal to threshold value.
          -t#       Threshold pixel type:
                    # = 1: integer (default)
                        2: short
                        3: unsigned byte
                        4: float
                        5: double
                    Note -t option must precede -v
          -v#       threshold value  - integer unless -t used
          -h        Help - prints this usage message
tcsh% 
\endverbatim
